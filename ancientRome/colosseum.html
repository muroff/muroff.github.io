<h2>About the Colosseum</h2>

<p>
The Colosseum is a giant ancient stadium in Rome, Italy. It was built almost 2,000 years ago, beginning in 72 AD under Emperor Vespasian and finished in 80 AD by his son Titus. Its original name was the Flavian Amphitheatre.

<p>
The Colosseum could hold about 50,000–70,000 people, which is similar to a modern football stadium. Romans came to watch gladiator fights, wild animal hunts, executions, and even mock naval battles.

<p>
The Colosseum is about 157 feet tall and made mostly of stone and concrete. It has 80 arches around the outside. The Romans were amazing engineers — they built underground tunnels called the hypogeum, where animals and gladiators waited before being lifted into the arena.
</p>

<p>
There was also a giant retractable awning called the velarium that helped shade the crowd from the hot sun.

<h2>Why It Was Important</h2>

<p>
The Colosseum showed the power and wealth of the Roman Empire. Emperors used the games to entertain the public and gain popularity. The events were free, which kept people happy and distracted from political problems.
