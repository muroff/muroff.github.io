  <center><h1>The Colosseum</h1></center>
  <p>The Colosseum is a giant ancient stadium in Rome, Italy. It was built almost 2,000 years ago, beginning in 72 AD under Emperor Vespasian and finished in 80 AD by his son Titus. Its original name was the Flavian Amphitheatre.</p>

<p>The Colosseum could hold about 50,000–70,000 people, which is similar to a modern football stadium. Romans came to watch gladiator fights, wild animal hunts, executions, and even mock naval battles.</p>

<center><h2>What Happened There?</h2></center>
<ul>
<li>Gladiator fights: Trained fighters battled each other with swords, shields, and other weapons.</li>

<li>Animal hunts (venationes): Wild animals like lions, tigers, elephants, and bears were brought from Africa and other parts of the empire.</li>

<li>Public executions: Criminals were sometimes killed as entertainment.</li>

<li>Mock sea battles: In rare cases, the arena may have been flooded to recreate naval battles.</li>
</ul>
<center><h2>How It Was Built</h2></center>

<p>The Colosseum is about 157 feet tall and made mostly of stone and concrete. It has 80 arches around the outside. The Romans were amazing engineers — they built underground tunnels called the hypogeum, where animals and gladiators waited before being lifted into the arena.</p>

<p>There was also a giant retractable awning called the velarium that helped shade the crowd from the hot sun.</p>

<center><h2>Why It Was Important</h2></center>

<p>The Colosseum showed the power and wealth of the Roman Empire. Emperors used the games to entertain the public and gain popularity. The events were free, which kept people happy and distracted from political problems.</p>

<center><h2>The Colosseum Today</h2></center>

<p>Today, the Colosseum is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Even though earthquakes and time have damaged it, much of it still stands. Around 7 million tourists visit each year, making it one of Italy’s most popular attractions.</p>
