            <h3>Engineering & Construction</h3>
            <p>Roman aqueducts usually began at springs or rivers high in the hills, where clean water could flow naturally downhill toward cities. Most of the system actually ran underground through tunnels called cuniculi, which were carved through rock to protect the water from enemies and harsh weather. When the route crossed valleys or low areas, engineers built massive arched bridges to keep the water moving at the right height. The entire system depended on a super gentle slope usually between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 allowing water to flow steadily without damaging the channels or stopping completely. Roman surveyors used tools like the dioptra, groma, and chorobates to measure land accurately despite having no modern technology. The channels were lined with waterproof cement called opus signinum, and sometimes finished with lead pipes near the end. In especially difficult terrain, they even used inverted siphons.</p>

            <h3>History, Scale & Famous Examples</h3>
            <p>Although earlier civilizations like the Greeks and Egyptians had water systems, the Romans expanded aqueduct technology on a massive scale. Their first major aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, was built in 312 BC and ran mostly underground for protection, stretching roughly 10 to 16 miles. By the 3rd century AD, Rome had developed 11 major aqueducts delivering enormous amounts of water every day to a population of over one million people. Much of this water supplied public baths, fountains, and gathering spaces. One famous surviving example is the Pont du Gard in France, a towering three-level bridge about 49 meters tall that once carried water more than 50 kilometers. Rome’s aqueduct network stretched hundreds of miles, though only about 30 miles were above ground.</p>

            <h3>Water Treatment, Distribution & Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Romans used settling tanks called piscina limaria to slow water so heavy debris could sink to the bottom. Some channels used zigzag patterns to reduce speed and allow more sediment to settle out. Open-air sections naturally aerated the water, improving taste and reducing odors. At the city’s edge, water entered distribution tanks known as castellum divisorium, dividing supplies between fountains, baths, and private homes. Maintenance crews regularly inspected tunnels and removed mineral buildup and debris to keep water flowing smoothly.</p>
