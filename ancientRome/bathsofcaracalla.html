            <li>Relax and socialize with friends</li>
            <li>Read and study in libraries</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>The baths also had rooms with different temperatures, which people moved through in order:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Caldarium (hot room): A very hot and steamy room used to relax muscles and help people sweat.</li>
            <li>Tepidarium (warm room): A warm room that helped the body adjust between hot and cold.</li>
            <li>Frigidarium (cold room): A cold bath used at the end to cool off and feel refreshed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This temperature system was part of the normal Roman bathing routine and was believed to help keep the body healthy.</p>
